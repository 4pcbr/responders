== Responders

A set of responders to dry up your Rails 3 app

== Generator

This gem also includes a responders controller generator, so your scaffold can be customized to use respond_with instead of default respond_to blocks just by configuring your environment:

  config.generators do |g|
    g.scaffold_controller = :responders_controller
  end
